Tutorials
=========

This section contains a variety of tutorials that should help get you started
with the `orthomap` package.

Prerequisites
-------------

- This tutorial assumes that you have basic **Python programming experience**.
  In particular, we assume you are familiar with using a notebook from the following python data science libraries:
  **jupyter**.
- To better understand plotting and data access, the user should try to get familiar with the python libraries:
  **pandas**, **matplotlib** and **seaborn**.
- `orthomap` is a python package but part of it can be run on the command line. For the installation of `orthomap`,
  we recommend using `Anaconda <https://anaconda.org>`_
  (`see here <https://orthomap.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation/index.html>`_).
  If you are not familiar with Anaconda or python environment management,
  please use `our pre-built docker image <https://orthomap.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation/index.html#docker-image>`_.

Code and data availability
--------------------------

- We provide links for the notebook in each section.

- You can download the demo input data using `orthomap` data loading function in the notebooks.
  `see here <https://orthomap.readthedocs.io/en/latest/modules/orthomap.html#modules-for-dataset-downloads>`_)
